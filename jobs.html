                <h1>Come join us building the communication network of the future!</h1>
                <p>
            Amdocs Unified Communications is a small and ambitious incubated startup located in Chiswick (UK) and Rennes (France). We have been building state-of-the-art communication apps for Mobile Network Operators who wish to compete with Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, and similar. 
                </p>
                <p>
However, in the last year we have been working on creating an open ecosystem for interoperable voice, video and messaging apps on the internet - defining an open spec called Matrix and releasing open source implementations of the spec that anyone can use. 
                </p>
                <p>
We want to give the power back to the user by moving from proprietary silos to an open, decentralised network. Anyone can run their own server, and you can encrypt the data you're sending end-to-end. We are building gateways and bridges to support as many existing apps as possible: ideally we would like the user to be able to choose which app they use, and still be able to talk to any other user, irrespective of their chosen app (just like email!).
                </p>
                <p>
If you are excited by this idea, check out our website - <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix.org</a> - and try out <a href="https://vector.im">Vector.im</a>, our Matrix-client. And maybe you even want to clone and run an instance of Synapse - our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">open source server</a>.      
                </p>
